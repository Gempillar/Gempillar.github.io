# Plato and Beyond

Gempillar is a company that communicates mathematical and scientific discoveries using different mediums such as paintings, video animations, and demonstrations via different projects.

H.S.M Coxeter quotes:

_"I'm a Platonist --- a follower of Plato --- who believes that one didn't invent these sort of things, that one discovers them.  In a sense, all these mathematical facts are right there waiting to be discovered."_
